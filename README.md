Note: After running the Stremio Jackett Add-on for the first time, a `config.json` file will be created in the same folder as the add-on executable. You can edit this file to configure the add-on.

Note 2: The Stremio Jackett Add-on executable needs to be running (along with Jackett) in order for this add-on to work in Stremio.

Note 3: Run the add-on with `--remote` (or set `remote` to `true` in `config.json`) to also receive an add-on url that will work through LAN and the Internet (instead of just locally).

Note 4: Setting `autoLaunch` to `true` in `config.json` will make the add-on auto launch on system start-up.
